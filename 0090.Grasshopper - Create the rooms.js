// You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least three properties (e.g. name, description, completed).

const rooms = {
  firstRoom: {
    name: "first room",
    description: "green",
    completed: true,
  },
  secondRoom: {
    name: "second room",
    description: "red",
    completed: true,
  },
  thirdRoom: {
    name: "third room",
    description: "black",
    completed: true,
  },
};
